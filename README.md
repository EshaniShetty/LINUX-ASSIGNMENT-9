# LINUX-ASSIGNMENT-9
Linux Programming Assignment 9: Mastering Bash control structures, including if-else conditional logic, case statements, for/while loops, and loop control with break and continue.

Overview
This repository focuses on Logic and Flow Control in Bash scripting. It covers how to make decisions using conditional statements and how to perform repetitive tasks efficiently using various loop structures.

Topics & Logic Covered
1. Conditional Statements
if...else: Used for testing conditions and expressions (e.g., checking if a number is even or odd or finding the largest of three numbers).

case Statement: Best used for matching a single variable against multiple patterns (like a menu selection). It is cleaner than multiple elif blocks for fixed choices.

2. Loop Structures
for Loop: Ideal for iterating over a fixed range of values or a list of items (e.g., printing numbers 1 to 5).

while Loop: Continues to execute as long as a specific condition remains true. Used in this assignment to create a functional Countdown Timer.

3. Loop Control
break: Immediately exits the entire loop, regardless of the condition.

continue: Skips the remaining code in the current iteration and moves directly to the next cycle of the loop.

4. File & User Interaction
File Existence Check: Using the -f flag within an if statement to verify if a file exists on the system before attempting to process it.

Math & Logic: Implementing modulus operators (%) and comparison operators (-gt, -lt, -eq) to handle numerical data.
